                        I'm a software engineering student at Holberton school, where I learned low-level C programming
                        with which we made a mini Linux shell.
                        Also, I learned to use data structures like double linked lists.
                        currently, I'm learning high-level programming in Python with which I make test-driven
                        development, more data structures like Hash tables and later will make an Airbnb console clon

                    <p>
                        The shell in Linux is a program that basically works by taking commands from the keyboard and
                        sending them to the operating system to execute them. The Mini Shell is a small replica of the
                        Ubuntu Linux shell. it was programmed in C like the original shell. its operation is quite
                        similar although it is a reduced version. you can try it on my github
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Puzzle, as its name indicates, is a puzzle game in which you will find a board on which there
                        are some pieces or pipes that you can rotate by clicking on them. The objective of the game is
                        to rotate these pipes to create a path from the origin to the end of the pipe and thus be able
                        to overcome the level.

                    <h2>Notes Transponder</h2>
                    <p>
                        This application basically consists of changing a series of notes that you enter by clicking on
                        the piano notes and then you choose the number of positive or negative semitones to which you
                        want the notes that you previously entered to be transposed.
                        This is useful for instruments that have their notes transposed naturally like the saxophone or
                        also for lowering or raising the pitch of a song.
                    </p>
